-iframe: it is known an html page in the another html page - inner html

NOTE: Selenium can focus one thing at a time. 



In the below case, there is an outer (parent iframe) and inner (child iframe).
-if you need to click or take any action in the inner iframe, then you will need switch selenium focus to that specific iframe first.
-Otherwise, you will get NoSuchElementException

<html>
	<head>

	</head>

	<body>
	<iframe>
		<html>
			<head>

			</head>

			<body>

			</body>

		</html>
	</iframe>
	</body>

</html>




IN THE JIRA

TC123: Validate the IFrame Page content paragraph
Go to https://techglobal-training.com/frontend/iframes
Validate the "Please fill out your information below" paragraph




NOTE: There are two ways to switch back to the parent iFrame
driver.switchTo().parentFrame(); --> this will go back to the parent
driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); --> this will go back to default html


What is their difference?
parentFrame() method moves back to direct parent
defaultContent() method moves back to all the way to default html (first)




How to find all iFrames in a HTML DOM?
How to find all images in a HTML DOM?
How to find all links in a HTML DOM?
How to find all h1 in a HTML DOM?

driver.findElements(By.tagName("iframe"));



MULTIPLE WINDOWS TESTING
WindowHandle: it is the unique id given to each browser window or the tab


driver.getWindowHandle(); // returns the id of the current tab/window
driver.getWindowHandles(); // returns all the ids of existing tabs



Set<String> allWindows = driver.getWindowHandles();


-Set allows only unique elements
-No insertion order



NoSuchElementException: When element is not found in the DOM.

StaleElementReferenceException: When your driver loses reference of the element in the DOM. 
Your driver locates the element once but then it loses it in the DOM.


NoSuchWindowException: When the window Selenium focused does not exists anymore.

NoSuchAlertException: When you dismiss or accept an alert and still trying to take action on it.
