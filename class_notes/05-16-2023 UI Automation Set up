HTML: All the web pages displayed on a web browser is created using HTML tags. 

EXAMPLE: p, a, ul, li, img....

Each HTML tag is displayed as a web element on a web page.


Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera


Web Page: Each html DOM structure is known as a web page

<html>
	HTML PAGE
</html>


Web Element: Each tag displayed on a web page.

<button type="submit">Login</button>
<tagName attribute="value">VISIBLE TEXT</tagName>


Tag: button, strong, img, a, ol, ul, li, div, p, h1, h6, hr, br, table, tr, thead, tbody, td, th, form, div, span, html, body, head, title, input 


Attribute: type, href, height, width, target, id, class, style, placeholder, for


Property: usually used in the style attribute, they are also key and value pairs like color="blue"


Element Text: This is the text displayed between the opening and the closing tags.




TEST CASE
-Step by step instructions to test an expected behavior of an application.


Go to https://www.google.com/
Validate that the user see a search input box

Given the user is on https://www.google.com/
Then the user should see a search input box


EXPECTED: Search input box should be there
ACTUAL: Search input box was there

PASSED




STEPS TO EXECUTE:
1. Launch a browser (Google Chrome)
2. Go to URL given
3. Validate your test cases



TEST CASE vs TEST SCRIPT
Test case: it is a terminology used in manual environment
Test script: it is a terminology used in automation environment

Test script is the automated test case



We will set up Selenium WebDriver to use its libraries (many classes and interfaces, they bring many useful methods)



BASIC JAVA PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE
	project
		src



MAVEN PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE
	project
		src
			main
				java
				resources
			test
				java

	target

	pom.xml


NOTE:
-main package is used by DEVELOPERs to build the application
-test package is used by QAs and DEVELOPERs (Unit tests) to write their tests


XML looks similar to HTML as it works with tags
XML -> Extensible Markup Language - safer
HTML -> HyperText Markup Language



DEPENDENCIES = LIBRARIES, JARs etc.



TestNG
-It is a tool used for Unit Testing but we also use it to organize our tests using its annotations

NOTE: if you have multiple tests in a class using @Test annotation, they will be executed alphabetically. If you would like to change the order as you wish, you can use priority property.

EXAMPLE:
    @Test(priority = 1)
    public void test1(){
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }


@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod
-There will be some situation that we will need to run some code before each @Test and after each @Test
-In this case, we can use @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod
-@BeforeMethod is used for pre-conditions of the test case. Also know as set up actions
-@AfterMethod is used for post-conditions of the test case. Also known as tearDown actions
