Maven recap:
-Build tool: open source tool mostly used with Java and helps programmers to keep their dependencies (libraries-jars).
-pom.xml: it comes with Maven project and we can store all our dependencies here with their versions. This will make updating version easier.
-Maven provides all the reports in a folder called as target.


TestNG recap: open source tool developed for Unit Testing but we also use it as testers. It is mostly used with Java.
SOME ADVANTAGES:
	-Annotations: are used to organize our tests
	-Reports: provides simple reports
	-Assertions - validation: provides assertions to validate tests
	-Priority: allows programmers to set order of tests

@Test annotation
-This is the block that our scripts is written. This will be reported as PASSED or FAILED.

@BeforeMethod annotation
-used to execute pre-conditions for the tests in a class
-it runs for each @Test method
-used for set up purposes


@AfterMethod annotation
-used to execute post-conditions for the tests in a class
-it runs for each @Test method
-used for teardown purposes


WebDriverManager recap:
-Helps programmer to set up desired browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Opera.



SeleniumWebDriver recap:
-Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers.
-It allows programmers to automate user actions on a specific application on web browser.


TYPES OF APPLICATION
-web application: any application you visit on a web browser
-desktop application: IntelliJ IDEA, Slack, Excel, Adobe
-mobile application: any application you download from AppleStore or PlayStore



SELENIUM BASIC OPERATIONS

1. Launch a browser - instantiate the desired browser object
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();


In the above, we can see that polymorphism is used since we see both FirefoxDriver and ChromeDriver in the shape of WebDriver.
WebDriver is the parent interface
FirefoxDriver and ChromeDriver are the child classes that directly or indirectly implements the WebDriver interface.



2. Maximize the browser window - to prevent some elements invisibility
driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.manage().window().fullscreen();


3. Implicit wait - to prevent snychronization issues
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

NOTE: Web browsers are way slow compared to source code (programming language)

-This will make your driver wait UP TO given seconds before it throws NoSuchElementException.
-The interval between each attempt to locate the particular element is 0.5 seconds (500 millis). At least 60 attempt when 30 seconds is defined.
-This is not a HARD-PAUSE and the driver will continue with the next action once the element is located (found).


HARD-PAUSE: only used for demo purposes
Thread.sleep(5000); // hard freeze for 5 seconds

Thread.sleep() method belongs to Java libraries.



4. Navigate to a web application with their url
driver.get("applicationURL"); // navigates us to specified URL


5. Teardown the browser session
driver.quit(); // closes all the tabs and quits the browser session
driver.close(); // closes only current tab


6. Locating elements
driver.findElement(); // locating single element
driver.findElements(); // locating multiple elements

WebElement element = driver.findElement();
List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements();


7. Validate title and the URL of the web page
driver.getTitle(); // returns the actual title of the web page as a String

driver.getCurrentUrl(); // return the actual url of the web page as a String




8. Selenium navigation operations
driver.navigate().back(); 
driver.navigate().forward(); 
driver.navigate().refresh();
driver.navigate().to();


driver.navigate().to() vs driver.get()
-driver.get() has an implicit wait implemented with it and it will wait until the HTML DOM structure (page) is loaded.
-driver.navigate().to() will not wait for page to be loaded and it has more risks that our test case can fail.

*** to navigate to browser page -> driver.get() is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!



SELENIUM LOCATORS
-Selenium provides us 8 different locators to find the elements in the DOM structure and use them in our automation scripts.

1. id
2. CSS
3. Xpath
4. name
5. className
6. tagName
7. linkText
8. partialLinkText


HOW TO LOCATE AN ELEMENT
1. Have developers tools open -> right click on the page and inspect
2. Make sure you are on the "Elements" developer tool
3. Click on "Select Element" icon in the developer tools and make sure it is blue (activated)
4. Click on the web page element you would like to locate



validateTitleAndURL
Go to https://www.apple.com/
Validate its title is apple
Validate its URL is https://www.apple.com/
