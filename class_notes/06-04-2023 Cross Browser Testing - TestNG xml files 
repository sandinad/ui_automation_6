Selenium advantages:
	-open source tools to automate browsers
	-supports multiple programming languages
	-supports multiple browsers
	-supports multiple OS
	-supports multiple automation frameworks
	-easy to learn and implement
	-supports parallel testing with Selenium Grid
	-Flexible ways to interact with web elements
	-HUGE COMMUNITY SUPPORT


Selenium disadvantages:
	-slow compared to other automation tools like Cypress and Playwright
	-works with ONLY web-based applications
	-CANNOT automate barcodes, captchas, images, graphics, maps, PDFs
	-CANNOT automate multi-factor authentication
	-Synchronization is effort to implement
	-Reports are not good to present so it needs third party tools like TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, Allure Reports, Extend Reports, Jenkins


CROSS BROWSER TESTING:
Have you ever involve in Cross Browser Testing?
-Yes, I executed my scripts on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge.

It is known as testing the same test cases on different platforms-browsers.

What are the challenges comes with cross-browser testing?
-Implementation: code refactoring to adapt new browser testing by using switch cases or if-else statements

BIGGEST CHALLENGE: Different browser supports different implementation and your test scripts may pass on some browsers while they fail for some others.


Chrome = 2 passed - 12 seconds
Firefox = 2 passed - 19 seconds
Safari = 2 passed - 21 seconds


Regression (all test cases): Chrome
Smoke (5-15 test cases): Cross-Browser



FRAMEWORK IMPROVEMENTS:
GLOBAL VARIABLES READ MECHANISM:
browser=chrome
app_url=www.
implicit_wait=30
explicit_wait=30


1. We store all the global environment variables in a file
	This file could be any type of file like json, txt, java, properties
2. Create some useful methods to read the global environment variables
3. We will use these methods to fetch data in your framework



ConfigurationReader.getProperty("browser"); // "chrome"
ConfigurationReader.getProperty("implicit_wait"); // "30"




TESTNG xml files
-These xml files are used to define different suites and exucute them separately
-EXAMPLE: Smoke, Regression, Functionao, End to end, Login



Create a suite called as smoke.xml
	_01_GoogleTest -> validateSearchBar
	_03_TGLocatorsTest -> validateAllParagraphs
	_05_FacebookTest -> validateFacebookLoginForm
	_06_WikiTest -> validateWikiSearch1


Create a suite called as regression.xml
	Have all the test cases except the ones in the Smoke


How do you decide what is Smoke or Regression?
	-Among all the test cases, we mark the most critical ones as Smoke and the rest to be Regression.
